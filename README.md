### Crystal Collector Game
--------------------
######  A random number is given  at the start of the game.

###### There are four cristals on the screen. By clicking on a crystal you will add a specific amount of points to your total score.

###### You win the game by matching your total score to the random number, you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number.

###### The value of each crystal is hidden from you until you click on it.
